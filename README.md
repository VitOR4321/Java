# Java
Repository for my pojeky written in the Java programming language.
I wrote the projects in 2 Frameworks :
- Eclipse
- Intelij
---
# Algorithms and data structures (AISD)
The folder contains programs in which I wrote various data structures, for example:

- priority queue
- one-way and two-way list
- binary tree
- mound
- graph

In a subfolder named Project_SEM is a project I did for a course credit in college. The project data picture contains the command to execute (in Polish language), and in the folder with name "src" is the source code.
